# Analysis of survey's output

We presents the main concepts we extracted from the survey we executed with developers that migrated Java code to Kotlin.
The concepts are grouped by categories.

## Support

*	Like Google support 	
*	Like JetBrains support	
*	Adopted due to coolness factor	
*	Highlight Importance of IDE for Kotlin

## Advantage Kotlin code w.r.t development and maintainability

*	Little-to-none boilerplate code
*	Easier to read/clear/write/syntactic sugar/easier to mantain
*	Code more dense/heavy
*	Less Redundant/less verbose 
*	Kotlin has clear syntax
*	Kotlin is a Modern language/has features from Modern Languages


## Design

*	Ease implementing MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture
*	Easeimplementing MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel ) architecture
*	Availability of Built-in design patterns (e.g., Extension functions)


## Relation with other languages

*	Dont want to use Java anymore
*	Like  Python
*	Like Scala
*	Like Kotlin Features from C++
*	Dont lile Java
*	Like Koltin Features from Haskell
*	More similarity with Java w.r.t other JVM lang
*	Similar to Swift
*	Not fan of Kotlin
*	Kotlin has more extensions than Java native package
*   Find Java a limitation from Android development

## Kotlin Code features

*	Like Operator overloading 	
*	Higlight Interoperab Java	
*	More features than 	
*	Find Kotlin Safer than java	
*	Like Null safety/Nullability support		
*	Like Immutability	
*	Like Coroutine	
*	Find Coroutines  are complex	
*	Use Coroutines instead of ReactiveX	
*	Like Data Class (POJO )	
*	Like no getters/setters	
*	Like smart cast	
*	Like Dependency Injection mechanism			
*	Like lambdas/Higher-Order	
*	Like Streams	
*	Like  built-in API for manipulating collections	
*	Like Scope Function	
*	Like Functional programming available in Kotlin	
*	Highlight Kotlin standard/built-in library	
*	Like Function as parameters/Higher Order functions	
*	Like When instruction		
*	Like sealed classes 	
*	Like Type Inference		
*	Like Extension Functions		
*	Like default parameters	
*	Like named parameters/arguments	


## Productivity with Kotlin	

*	Faster deliver
*	Faster development
*	Increase Productivity



# Auto-Converted 

*  Use converted along the migration process
*  Use Converter for staring the migration then continue migrating without using it (manual coding)
*  Had issues when converting using auto-converted

## Migration process:

*	Migrated only by hand (Only Manual coding)
*	Only new feature implemented in Kotlin
*	Add Java code only to fix legacy code
*	Only New files in Kotlin/Old code keep in Java
*	Migrating using "Boy scout rule"
*	Started Migration with test clases 
*	Started Migration with data class (POJO)
*	Migrated in one step (commit)
*	No time to finish
*  App developed/migrated to learn Kotlin


## Running platforms:

* Like Kotlin to write server-side applications
* Interested in Multiplatform with Kotlin
